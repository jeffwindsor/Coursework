/// These are F# solutions of Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems

/// which are themselves translations of Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems
/// (http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)
/// and Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems
/// (https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems).
///
/// If you would like to contribute a solution or fix any bugs, send 
/// an email to paks at kitiara dot org with the subject "99 F# problems". 
/// I'll try to update the problem as soon as possible.
///
/// The problems have different levels of difficulty. Those marked with a single asterisk (*) 
/// are easy. If you have successfully solved the preceeding problems you should be able to 
/// solve them within a few (say 15) minutes. Problems marked with two asterisks (**) are of 
/// intermediate difficulty. If you are a skilled F# programmer it shouldn't take you more than 
/// 30-90 minutes to solve them. Problems marked with three asterisks (***) are more difficult. 
/// You may need more time (i.e. a few hours or more) to find a good solution
///
/// Though the problems number from 1 to 99, there are some gaps and some additions marked with 
/// letters. There are actually only 88 problems.

/// A binary tree is either empty or it is composed of a root element and two successors, 
/// which are binary trees themselves.
/// 
///                              (a)
///                             /   \
///                            (b)  (c)
///                           /  \    \
///                         (d)  (e)  (f)
///
/// In F#, we can characterize binary trees with a type definition: 
/// 

type 'a Tree = Empty | Branch of 'a * 'a Tree * 'a Tree

///
/// This says that a Tree of type a consists of either an Empty node, or a Branch containing one 
/// value of type a with exactly two subtrees of type a.
///  
/// Given this definition, the tree in the diagram above would be represented as: 
/// 

let tree1 = Branch ('a', Branch ('b', Branch ('d', Empty, Empty),
                               Branch ('e', Empty, Empty)),
                         Branch ('c', Empty,
                               Branch ('f', Branch ('g', Empty, Empty),
                                           Empty))) 

/// Since a "leaf" node is a branch with two empty subtrees, it can be useful to define a 
/// shorthand function:

let leaf x = Branch (x, Empty, Empty) 

/// Then the tree diagram above could be expressed more simply as: 

let tree1' = Branch ('a', Branch ('b', leaf 'd',
                               leaf 'e'),
                          Branch ('c', Empty,
                               Branch ('f', leaf 'g',
                                           Empty)))
/// Other examples of binary trees: 
/// 
/// -- A binary tree consisting of a root node only
let tree2 = Branch ('a', Empty, Empty)
///  
/// -- An empty binary tree
let tree3 = Empty
///  
/// -- A tree of integers

// [snippet: (*) Problem 54A : Check whether a given term represents a binary tree.]
/// In Prolog or Lisp, one writes a predicate to do this. 
/// 
/// Example in Lisp: 
/// * (istree (a (b nil nil) nil))
/// T
/// * (istree (a (b nil nil)))
/// NIL
///  
/// Non-solution: 
/// F#'s type system ensures that all terms of type 'a Tree are binary trees: it is just not 
//  possible to construct an invalid tree with this type. Hence, it is redundant to introduce 
/// a predicate to check this property: it would always return True
// [/snippet]

// [snippet: (**) Problem 55 : Construct completely balanced binary trees]
/// In a completely balanced binary tree, the following property holds for every node: 
/// The number of nodes in its left subtree and the number of nodes in its right subtree 
/// are almost equal, which means their difference is not greater than one.
///  
/// Write a function cbal-tree to construct completely balanced binary trees for a given 
/// number of nodes. The predicate should generate all solutions via backtracking. Put 
/// the letter 'x' as information into all nodes of the tree.
///  
/// Example: 
/// * cbal-tree(4,T).
/// T = t(x, t(x, nil, nil), t(x, nil, t(x, nil, nil))) ;
/// T = t(x, t(x, nil, nil), t(x, t(x, nil, nil), nil)) ;
/// etc......No

/// [
///    permutation 1
