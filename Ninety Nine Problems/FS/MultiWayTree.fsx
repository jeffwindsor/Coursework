/// A complete binary tree with height H is defined as follows:

///   level i)
/// • In level H, which may contain less than the maximum possible number of nodes, 
///   all the nodes are "left-adjusted". This means that in a levelorder tree traversal all 
///   internal nodes come first, the leaves come second, and empty successors (the 
///   nil's which are not really nodes!) come last.
///  
/// Particularly, complete binary trees are used as data structures (or addressing 
/// schemes) for heaps.
///  
/// We can assign an address number to each node in a complete binary tree by 
/// enumerating the nodes in level-order, starting at the root with number 1. For every 
/// node X with address A the following property holds: The address of X's left and right 
/// successors are 2*A and 2*A+1, respectively, if they exist. This fact can be used to 
/// elegantly construct a complete binary tree structure.

// [snippet: (**) Problem 68 : Preorder and inorder sequences of binary trees]
/// Preorder and inorder sequences of binary trees. We consider binary trees with 
/// nodes that are identified by single lower-case letters, as in the example of problem 
/// P67.
///  
/// a) Write predicates preorder/2 and inorder/2 that construct the preorder and inorder 
/// sequence of a given binary tree, respectively. The results should be atoms, e.g. 
/// 'abdecfg' for the preorder sequence of the example in problem P67.
///  
/// b) Can you use preorder/2 from problem part a) in the reverse direction; i.e. given a 
/// preorder sequence, construct a corresponding tree? If not, make the necessary 
/// arrangements.
///  
/// c) If both the preorder sequence and the inorder sequence of the nodes of a binary 
/// tree are given, then the tree is determined unambiguously. Write a predicate 
/// pre_in_tree/3 that does the job.
///  
/// Example in F#: 
/// 
/// Main> let { Just t = stringToTree "a(b(d,e),c(,f(g,)))" ;
///             po = treeToPreorder t ;
///             io = treeToInorder t } in preInTree po io >>= print
/// Branch 'a' (Branch 'b' (Branch 'd' Empty Empty) (Branch 'e' Empty Empty))

/// Example in F#:

/// > dotString2Tree  "abd..e..c.fg...";;
