// [snippet: (**) Problem 90 : Eight queens problem]
/// This is a classical problem in computer science. The objective is to place eight queens on a 
/// chessboard so that no two queens are attacking each other; i.e., no two queens are in the 
/// same row, the same column, or on the same diagonal.
///  
/// Hint: Represent the positions of the queens as a list of numbers 1..N. Example: 
/// [4,2,7,3,6,8,5,1] means that the queen in the first column is in row 4, the queen in the 
/// second column is in row 2, etc. Use the generate-and-test paradigm.
///  
/// Example in F#: 
/// 
/// > queens 8 |> Seq.length;;
/// val it : int = 92
/// > queens 8 |> Seq.head;;
/// val it : int list = [1; 5; 8; 6; 3; 7; 2; 4]
/// > queens 20 |> Seq.head;;
/// val it : int list =
///  [1; 3; 5; 2; 4; 13; 15; 12; 18; 20; 17; 9; 16; 19; 8; 10; 7; 14; 6; 11]

(*[omit:(Solution)]*)
// instead of solving the problem for 8 queens lets solve if for N queens.
// To solve the problem we are going to start with an empty board and then we're going
// add queen to it for each row. Elimitating invalid solutions. To do that we need a function
// (invalidPosition) that detects if one queen is in conflict with another one. And another 
// function (validSolution) that would test if the queen that we're adding is not in 
// conflict with any queen already on the board. 
// Also, the solution is going to return a a sequence of solutions instead of a list.
// That way we can get one solution realy fast if that is only what we care. For example 
// getting all the solutions for a 20x20 board would take a long time, but finding 
// the first solution only takes 5 seconds.

// [snippet: (**) Problem 91 : Knight's tour]
/// Another famous problem is this one: How can a knight jump on an NxN chessboard in such a way 
/// that it visits every square exactly once? A set of solutions is given on the The_Knights_Tour
/// page.
///  
/// Hints: Represent the squares by pairs of their coordinates of the form X/Y, where both X and 
/// Y are integers between 1 and N. (Note that '/' is just a convenient functor, not division!) 
/// Define the relation jump(N,X/Y,U/V) to express the fact that a knight can jump from X/Y to U/V 
/// on a NxN chessboard. And finally, represent the solution of our problem as a list of N*N knight
/// positions (the knight's tour).
///  
/// There are two variants of this problem: 
/// 1. find a tour ending at a particular square 
/// 2. find a circular tour, ending a knight's jump from the start (clearly it doesn't matter where 
///    you start, so choose (1,1))

// in the board that have not being used. Also we have a function (moves) that returns a 
// list of posible moves from the current position. The variable 'validMoves' is the result of
// removing all the positions returned by 'moves' that are not in the set 'board' (positions 
// that are still available). If validMoves is empty, that means that we can not move 
// anymore. If at that time the board is empty, we have a solution! Otherwise we remove the 
// current position from the board add the curent position to the tour and continue to one 
// of the valid moves.
// Now, the trick to make the algorithm converge is to move first to the valid position

// this is what drives the solution to this problem and 
// came from the haskell solution.
// Here is an example of its use:
// > splits [1..4];;
// val it : (int list * int list) list =
//  [([1], [2; 3; 4]); ([1; 2], [3; 4]); ([1; 2; 3], [4])]
// As you can see, it returs all the ways we can split a list.
let splits xs = List.tail (init (List.zip (inits xs) (tails xs)))

// Now that we're armed with all these functions, we're ready to tackle the real problem.

// The goal of the function expressions is to build all valid expressions and its value given a 
// list  of numbers. First we split the list in all posible ways (1). Then we take
// the left side of the split and build all the valid expresions (2). We do the same for the
// right side (3). Now we combine the two expresions with all the operators (4). If the operation
// is valid, we add it to the list of expressions (5,6).
let rec expressions = function
    | [x] -> [(Val x, x)]
    | xs  -> [ for xsl, xsr in splits xs do (* 1 *)
                for (expl, vall) in expressions xsl do (* 2 *)
                    for (expr, valr) in expressions xsr do (* 3 *)

                                yield (App (op, expl, expr) ,app op vall valr) (* 6 *)]


// Now that we have a way of generating valid expressions, it's time to
// generate the equaions. Again, we split the list of numbers (1). Then we generate the 
// list of expressions from the left side of the split (2). Same with the right side (3).
// If both expressions have the same value, add it to our soutions (4,5).
